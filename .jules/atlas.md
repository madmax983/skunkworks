**[Title] Fix capacity overflow panic in origami
**Tangle:** The `crates/origami/src/lib.rs` file calculated capacity for `Vec::with_capacity` using user-provided input parameters, but failed to bound the capacity allocation against the process limits (`isize::MAX / size_of<T>`), causing fatal `capacity overflow` panics.
**Blueprint:** Replaced unbounded vector capacities with `if c <= isize::MAX / ...` bounds checks that fallback to returning empty instances rather than panicking on absurd input sizes.
