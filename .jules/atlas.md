**[Title] Fix capacity overflow panic in origami
**Tangle:** The `crates/origami/src/lib.rs` file calculated capacity for `Vec::with_capacity` using user-provided input parameters, but failed to bound the capacity allocation against the process limits (`isize::MAX / size_of<T>`), causing fatal `capacity overflow` panics.
**Blueprint:** Replaced unbounded vector capacities with `if c <= isize::MAX / ...` bounds checks that fallback to returning empty instances rather than panicking on absurd input sizes.

**[Title] Encapsulate tui-shared modules
**Tangle:** The `crates/tui-shared/src/lib.rs` leaked internal modules via `pub mod`, breaking the intended Facade pattern.
**Blueprint:** Changed `pub mod action`, `entity`, `region`, and `snapshot` to `pub(crate) mod` to enforce strict boundaries while preserving re-exports.
