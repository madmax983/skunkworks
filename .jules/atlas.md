## YYYY-MM-DD - [Semantic Bridge Extraction]
**Tangle:** The Blob - `crates/tui-shared/src/semantic.rs` was ~565 lines long, mixing several domain distinct concepts (`Entity`, `Region`, `Snapshot`, `Action`, and `PropValue`) into a single file.
**Blueprint:** Extracted the types into separate modules (`entity.rs`, `region.rs`, `snapshot.rs`, `action.rs`) under `crates/tui-shared/src/semantic/`, and converted `crates/tui-shared/src/semantic.rs` (now `semantic/mod.rs`) into a facade that `pub use`s these types. This improves cohesion, limits file length, and cleanly bounds the domain logic without breaking consumer imports.

## YYYY-MM-DD - [Chimera TUI Blob Extraction]
**Tangle:** The Blob - `experiments/chimera-lang/src/tui/mod.rs` was ~4800 lines long. Most of this was a monolithic `run_app` event loop with thousands of lines of `match` blocks handling input for over 40 different `ViewMode` variants inside a single `event::read()?` branch.
**Blueprint:** Extracted `run_app` into a new module `app/mod.rs`. Extracted the three main input handling branches (Editing, View Selector, Normal) into a new `app/handlers.rs` file. This drastically simplifies the event loop and paves the way for further domain-specific input handler files.
