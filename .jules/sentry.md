## [Division Panic Handling]
**Learning:** Checking for division by zero (`b == 0`) is insufficient to prevent panics in Rust integer division. `i64::MIN / -1` also causes a panic due to overflow.
**Action:** Always test both `x / 0` and `MIN / -1` when implementing integer division.

## [ChimeraVM Stack Order]
**Learning:** In `ChimeraVM`, the stack is a `Vec<Value>`. `push` adds to the end (top). `pop` removes from the end (top). When OpCodes describe arguments like "stack: A, B (top)", `B` is the last element pushed and the first popped. This means code should `push(A); push(B);` to match that state.
**Action:** When writing tests that manually construct stack states via `OpCode::Push`, ensure the push order matches the documented stack expectation (bottom to top).
